In this study, 250 mice identified with Squamos Cell Carcinoma tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 

The regimen of Capomulin was effective in reducing the average tumor volume in mice over a 45 day period. We also show that there is a strong and tight correlation between tumor size and mouse weight, hinting that correlating only the final tumor volume to regime effectiveness without first standardizing mouse weight would greatly skew the calculation of the regimine efficacy.
